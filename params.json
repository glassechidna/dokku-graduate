{"name":"Dokku-graduate","tagline":"A simple environment lifecyle management plugin for dokku.","body":"### Dokku Graduate\r\n\r\nDokku Graduate is a simple plug-in for Dokku that helps manage the deployment of multiple Dokku apps to multiple environments (```development```, ```staging```, ```UAT```, ```production``` etc).\r\n\r\n### What problem does this plugin solve?\r\n\r\nLarger projects are frequently made up of multiple apps. Whilst Dokku does a fantastic job of managing individual apps and making their deployment a breeze. Dokku does not directly handle the situation of having multiple apps that interact with each other, or depend on each other.\r\n\r\n#### An Example\r\n\r\nSay we have two Dokku apps running in both ```development``` and in ```production```. One app is a Rails website, called ```portal```, and the other is set of Sinatra web-services called ```webservices```. Both of these apps share the same data mode, and the same data store (e.g. a PostgreSQL database). ```portal``` is an admin interface and ```webservices``` is for consumers.\r\n\r\nWe want to deploy updated projects with a new data model to ```production```. Typically you'd write a Rails migration which you could then kick off as a Dokku hook, or perhaps manually once ```portal``` has deployed to ```production```. However, what happens to ```webservices```, which is also using the same data store? A new ```webservices``` that understands the updated data model also needs to be deployed.\r\n\r\nWe can't deploy ```webservices``` after ```portal``` and the migration have run, because after the migration has run the old ```webservices``` will still be running and trying to use the old data model with the new data store structure.\r\n\r\nWe can't deploy the new ```webservices``` before ```portal```, because the migration is yet to run and ```webservices``` will try use the new data model on the old data store. This would be particularly problematic if ```portal``` failed to deploy!\r\n\r\nDokku Graduate helps solve this problem.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nDokku Graduate allows you to __graduate__ an entire set of apps in one environment to another environment. However, we do not simply deploy all the apps and let them go live one at a time. Apps will *not* go live (e.g. have their ports exposed) until they themselves, and all their peers, have passed Dokku's *check-install* phase.\r\n\r\nDokku Graduate also provides its own set of hooks, including its own **POST** [deployment] hook, that is called after every app has deployed and passed Dokku's *check-install* phase. Dokku Graduate's **POST** hook gives you an opportunity to kick off a process that will affect multiple apps running in the one environment (e.g. a database migration), or run any sort of environment wide tests. If a **POST** hook fails, then the whole graduation is aborted, and none of the apps will go live.\r\n\r\n#### Back to the example\r\n\r\nUsing Dokku Graduate, we would perform our database migration as a **POST** hook. Then we would graduate from ```development``` to ```production```; deploying both apps to ```production``` and performing Dokku *check-install* hooks for both ```portal``` and ```webservices```, and our database migration (the Dokku Graduate **POST** hook) *before* anything becomes publicly accessible. If either app fails to deploy, or the migration were to fail then the entire graduation would be aborted ensuring ```production``` is not left in broken state. Great!\r\n\r\n_**Note:**_ _I feel I should mention that, in this example, there is still a small window of time where you would have to take some care to ensure that the old (publicly accessible) app/Docker instances for ```portal``` and ```webservices``` don't try access the data store during/after the migration._\r\n\r\nTo be clear, Dokku Graduate isn't just useful for database migrations. It's also very useful if you have apps that depend on each other. For example, if ```portal``` were to consume private web services provided by ```webservices``` and you want to change the API. Or, perhaps if ```portal``` and ```webservices``` mutually consume each others' functionality!\r\n\r\n### I'm sold.
