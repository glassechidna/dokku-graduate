<p>Dokku Graduate is a simple plug-in for Dokku that helps manage the deployment of multiple Dokku apps to multiple environments (<code>development</code>, <code>staging</code>, <code>UAT</code>, <code>production</code> etc).</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-problem-does-this-plugin-solve" class="anchor" href="#what-problem-does-this-plugin-solve" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What problem does this plugin solve?</h3>

<p>Larger projects are frequently made up of multiple apps. Whilst Dokku does a fantastic job of managing individual apps and making their deployment a breeze. Dokku does not directly handle the situation of having multiple apps that interact with each other, or depend on each other.</p>

<h4>
<a id="an-example" class="anchor" href="#an-example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An Example</h4>

<p>Say we have two Dokku apps running in both <code>development</code> and in <code>production</code>. One app is a Rails website, called <code>portal</code>, and the other is set of Sinatra web-services called <code>webservices</code>. Both of these apps share the same data mode, and the same data store (e.g. a PostgreSQL database). <code>portal</code> is an admin interface and <code>webservices</code> is for consumers.</p>

<p>We want to deploy updated projects with a new data model to <code>production</code>. Typically you'd write a Rails migration which you could then kick off as a Dokku hook, or perhaps manually once <code>portal</code> has deployed to <code>production</code>. However, what happens to <code>webservices</code>, which is also using the same data store? A new <code>webservices</code> that understands the updated data model also needs to be deployed.</p>

<p>We can't deploy <code>webservices</code> after <code>portal</code> and the migration have run, because after the migration has run the old <code>webservices</code> will still be running and trying to use the old data model with the new data store structure.</p>

<p>We can't deploy the new <code>webservices</code> before <code>portal</code>, because the migration is yet to run and <code>webservices</code> will try use the new data model on the old data store. This would be particularly problematic if <code>portal</code> failed to deploy!</p>

<p>Dokku Graduate helps solve this problem.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Dokku Graduate allows you to <strong>graduate</strong> an entire set of apps in one environment to another environment. However, we do not simply deploy all the apps and let them go live one at a time. Apps will <em>not</em> go live (e.g. have their ports exposed) until they themselves, and all their peers, have passed Dokku's <em>check-install</em> phase.</p>

<p>Dokku Graduate also provides its own set of hooks, including its own <strong>POST</strong> [deployment] hook, that is called after every app has deployed and passed Dokku's <em>check-install</em> phase. Dokku Graduate's <strong>POST</strong> hook gives you an opportunity to kick off a process that will affect multiple apps running in the one environment (e.g. a database migration), or run any sort of environment wide tests. If a <strong>POST</strong> hook fails, then the whole graduation is aborted, and none of the apps will go live.</p>

<h4>
<a id="back-to-the-example" class="anchor" href="#back-to-the-example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Back to the example</h4>

<p>Using Dokku Graduate, we would perform our database migration as a <strong>POST</strong> hook. Then we would graduate from <code>development</code> to <code>production</code>; deploying both apps to <code>production</code> and performing Dokku <em>check-install</em> hooks for both <code>portal</code> and <code>webservices</code>, and our database migration (the Dokku Graduate <strong>POST</strong> hook) <em>before</em> anything becomes publicly accessible. If either app fails to deploy, or the migration were to fail then the entire graduation would be aborted ensuring <code>production</code> is not left in broken state. Great!</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>I feel I should mention that, in this example, there is still a small window of time where you would have to take some care to ensure that the old (publicly accessible) app/Docker instances for <code>portal</code> and <code>webservices</code> don't try access the data store during/after the migration.</em></p>

<p>To be clear, Dokku Graduate isn't just useful for database migrations. It's also very useful if you have apps that depend on each other. For example, if <code>portal</code> were to consume private web services provided by <code>webservices</code> and you want to change the API. Or, perhaps if <code>portal</code> and <code>webservices</code> mutually consume each others' functionality!</p>
